    "After studying Ancient technology, I think I understand! The Ancients manipulated zero-point energy to carve out pockets of space isolated from our universe. Their vault doors are actually multi-dimensional lenses which can be focused to allow passage into these pocket dimensions. I think I know how to follow in their footsteps.

Trial #211:

Eureka! My Tesseract Lens is complete! It opened a portal to a strange ... construct ... outside of our universe.",
    "This construct contains breathable air and gravity, but is otherwise totally empty. Imagine the possibilities of unlimited space! I've already moved some of my equipment into this world.

Trial #219:

Today was a bit of a setback. When I activated the Tesseract Lens, it displayed dimensional parameters encoded in the form of a long number. I thought nothing of it, and did not write it down. It turns out that was a mistake. After disassembling the lens",
    "and moving it to the other side of my lab, when I re-assembled it, the dimensional parameters had changed. When I stepped through the portal, I found myself in a new empty world. My equipment was gone! I wonder if I'll ever find that first pocket dimension... From now on, I'm writing down that number!"
