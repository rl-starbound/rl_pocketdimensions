# Starbound mod: Pocket Dimensions

This mod adds advanced technology to the Starbound universe. After studying the technology of the Ancients, particularly their vaults, [Elliott](https://starbounder.org/Outpost#Tech_Lab), the Outpost's resident tech scientist, has an epiphany about the nature of space-time. With your help, he invents the *Tesseract Lens*, a device capable of creating and transporting you to pocket dimensions within the folds of space-time. Constructing a Tesseract Lens consumes a hefty amount of high-tier resources, but the reward is access to a nearly infinite amount of free space.

The Tesseract Lens requires tuning hundreds of dimensional parameters to locate a safe pocket within space-time. Fortunately, it condenses all of these parameters into one convenient number for you to write down. And write it down you should... Elliott discovered this the hard way after his prototype Tesseract Lens was reset and he lost access to a pocket dimension that he had filled with his lab equipment. Perhaps one day some lucky dimensional explorer will stumble upon it, although the odds on that are worse than one in a billion.

Pocket dimensions work very similarly to terrestrial worlds. They have gravity and a breathable atmosphere, but lack any light source. You can build freely within their confines. All pocket dimensions are shared within the universe, so if someone sees the dimensional tuning number corresponding to a pocket dimension, they can travel to it, just as they can navigate to star systems using interstellar coordinates. Surprisingly, the interstellar teleporter network is compatible with pocket dimensions without any modifications; a Tesseract Lens is necessary to create a pocket dimension, but once created, if a teleporter is anchored within it, other teleporters can lock onto and beam to it. Despite this, it is important to remember that pocket dimensions are not terrestrial worlds, so certain technologies, such as terraformers, do not work within them.

## Compatibility Notes

The only real point of interaction with the vanilla universe is appending quests to Elliott, the Outpost lab scientist, so this mod should be widely compatible with other mods. Specifically, although this mod is similar in concept to Pocket World Mod, the mods share no code and should be fully compatible.

## Uninstallation

This mod can be uninstalled as desired, subject to the following caveats:

* When this mod is uninstalled, for any character that completed Elliott's Pocket Dimensions quests, when that character is first loaded after uninstall, the game will crash. However, if you re-launch the game and load the character again, play should resume on the character's ship. When play resumes, the Pocket Dimensions quests will have been removed from the quest journal, the Tesseract Lens will no longer be craftable, any Tesseract Lenses you had in inventory or containers will have become Perfectly Generic Items, and any Tesseract Lenses you had placed in worlds will cease to exist.
* If you had placed a teleporter inside of a pocket dimension and added it to your teleporter bookmarks, the entry will still exist after uninstall. If you attempt to teleport to that pocket dimension, you will re-materialize on your ship.
* Pocket dimensions that you created using this mod will not be deleted upon uninstall. They will continue to exist in your storage folder unless you remove them manually. If you reinstall this mod, you should be able to regain access to them in whatever state you left them.

## Credits

Nekobi's "Pocket World Mod" inspired this mod. I liked the concept, but had some very different ideas about how it should work, which inspired me to create this mod.
